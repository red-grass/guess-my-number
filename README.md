# Guess-My-Number

## Project Description
A JavaScript-based number guessing game where users try to guess a randomly generated number.

## Features 
* User input validation.
* Score tracking system.
* Interactive UI with dynamic feedback.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/red-grass/guess-my-number.git
cd guess-my-number
```

## Usage

## How it Works
The game generates a random number and compares it with user input. The score decreases with each incorrect guess, and feedback is provided based on the input range.
